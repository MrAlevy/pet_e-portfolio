# Final Project Evaluation

Working on the Autonomous Vehicle Simulation System as a student project was both challenging and enriching. Throughout the project, I encountered several difficulties, particularly in understanding and applying various UML diagrams correctly. Initially, conceptualizing how different components like the Vehicle, NavigationSystem, and ObstacleManager would interact within the system was complex. Creating class diagrams helped me visualize the structure and relationships, but integrating these into a functioning code required a deeper investigation.

Sequence diagrams were crucial later on for understanding the interactions between these components. But as I started coding, I realized that the diagrams didn't cover everythingâ€”especially handling unexpected errors or issues. I often had to go back and rethink the diagrams to make them match what was really happening in the code.

This project taught me a lot about when to use each type of diagram and how they can make coding smoother. It also showed me the importance of being flexible and ready to update my designs as I learned more about how the system actually worked. It was a solid experience in seeing how detailed planning upfront can really help in building complex systems, and how you have to be ready to adapt that plan as you go.
