# Discussion Topic: Factors which Influence Reusability

In evaluating the reusability factors listed by Padhy et al. (2018) for object-oriented software, a hierarchy of these factors can be built upon on their foundational impact on software development and maintenance.
</br>

- Architecture Driven Approach (ADP): The structure or architecture of a project is fundamental to its reusability. An architecture that is modular, scalable, and flexible facilitates the reuse of components across different projects by providing a clear, high-level structure that supports interchangeability and adaptability.
- Design Patterns (DP): The usage of design patterns promotes reusability by ensuring that software components are designed in a standardized way, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse them.
- Modules in the Program (MIP): Modular programming inherently supports reusability by breaking down a project into independent, interchangeable modules that can be reused in different contexts.
- An Algorithm Used in the Program (AP): Algorithms solve specific problems. When an algorithm is designed to be generic and abstract, it can be reused across different projects.
- Documentation in Project (DIP): Comprehensive documentation, including requirement specification analysis, supports reusability by making it easier for new developers to understand the software's functionality, structure, and requirements.
- Knowledge Requirement (KR): The accumulation of knowledge, including experiences, ideas, and reasoning, enhance reusability by providing developers with the necessary understanding to reuse components effectively.
- Test Cases/Test Design (TCTD): Well-designed test cases can be reused across projects to ensure that software components meet the required standards and function correctly in new contexts.
- Models in the Project (MP): Models that accurately represent the project task, including meaningful codes and solutions, can be reused to fast-track the development process in future projects.
- Requirement Analysis (RA): The process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product is crucial for ensuring that reusable components meet the necessary requirements in different projects.
- Service Contracts (SC): Define the interaction between different software components. Clear and well-defined service contracts facilitate reusability by ensuring that components can interact seamlessly when reused in different contexts.
- Used in the Data Project (UD): This factor highlights the importance of data reusability, indicating that data accumulated from previous projects can be reused to achieve targets in new projects.

This prioritization is based on the consideration that structural and design-related factors have a foundational impact on reusability, making it easier to integrate and reuse software components across different projects.
