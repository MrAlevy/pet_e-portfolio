# Thoughts on Units 4-6

At first, using tools like Pylint and Flake8 was challenging. I found the many warnings and errors overwhelming, and I resisted the strict rules they enforced. But as I kept using them, I began to see these tools as helpful partners in writing cleaner and more maintainable code.

When I learned about cyclomatic complexity, I was skeptical about its usefulness. It seemed like an abstract concept that didn't relate to real coding. However, after analyzing my functions, I noticed that higher complexity often led to more bugs and made testing harder. This realization was a turning point. I started simplifying complex functions, which improved readability and made debugging and testing easier.

This taught me that while best practices and metrics are important, they shouldn't overshadow the specific needs of each project. Simply following guidelines without understanding them can lead to overcomplicating things. I've learned to balance these rules with practical judgment, ensuring my code is high quality without unnecessary complexity.
