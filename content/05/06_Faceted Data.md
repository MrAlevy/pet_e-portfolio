# Faceted Data

In their 2016 article, Schmitz et al. discuss the concept of faceted data as a way to enhance system security and prevent data leakage. Faceted data refers to a method where information is categorized into various facets (dimensions), and access to these facets is controlled based on user roles and permissions. This approach ensures that users only see the data relevant to them, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

__Pros:__
- Enhanced Security: Faceted data helps limit the visibility of sensitive information, ensuring users can only access the necessary data. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious data leaks.
- Customizable Access Control: It allows fine-grained control over who sees what, which is useful in multi-user environments with different roles and responsibilities.
- Data Integrity: It ensures that users access accurate, context-specific information.
</br>

__Cons:__
- Complex Implementation: Implementing faceted data systems can be technically challenging, as it requires advanced role-based access control mechanisms and data categorization.
- Performance Issues: Depending on the size and complexity of the data, this method might introduce performance overhead when handling multiple facets for large datasets.
</br>

__Outline for Python Implementation:__
- Define User Roles: Create classes for different user roles.
- Categorize Data Facets: Implement methods to categorize and label data facets.
- Access Control: Use functions that grant access to specific facets based on user roles.
- Testing and Validation: Develop unit tests to ensure the correct handling of data facets and access permissions.
