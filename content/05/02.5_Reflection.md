# Thoughts on Units 1-3

During these units, I learned a lot about how different programming languages affect security, especially C and Python. Working with buffer overflow vulnerabilities in C was eye-opening. It surprised me how a simple mistake, like not checking the length of user input with functions like gets(), can lead to serious security problems. This made me realize the dangers of low-level memory management and how important it is for developers to write safe code.

When I tried to recreate a buffer overflow in Python, I appreciated how the language's built-in safety features prevent such issues. Python's automatic memory management and error handling stop these vulnerabilities from happening. This contrast made me think about the trade-offs between the control you have in languages like C and the safety provided by higher-level languages like Python. I started to question when it's better to use one over the other, especially for projects where security is critical.

This experience changed how I think about choosing programming languages. I realized that it's not just about performance or what I'm familiar with, but also about the security features of the language. In the future, I'll be more careful in selecting a language, making sure it fits the security needs of the project.
