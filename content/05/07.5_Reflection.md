# Thoughts on Units 7-12

Developing a secure application was both challenging and enlightening. When I built the API with Flask, I underestimated how complicated it would be to implement proper authentication and input validation. I initially thought a simple login feature would be enough. However, I soon realized that securing an application requires a deep understanding of potential attacks and a proactive approach to prevent them.

Implementing RSA encryption was particularly tough. While I understood the basic concepts, applying them revealed gaps in my knowledge about key management and encryption standards. I felt frustrated at times and doubted my abilities. But this challenge pushed me to research more, experiment, and ultimately gain a better understanding of cryptography. It reminded me that learning in cybersecurity is an ongoing process.

Working on the system's ontology was another area where I struggled. I questioned its practicality and thought it might be unnecessary. However, as I worked through it, I saw its value in clarifying system components and their interactions. It improved communication with my peers and provided a solid foundation for development. This taught me not to dismiss new methods too quickly and to stay open to tools that can enhance the development process.

Overall, these challenges highlighted how complex it is to develop secure applications. They forced me to face my limitations, adjust my approach, and embrace continuous learning. I now have a greater appreciation for the many aspects of security in software development and feel better prepared to tackle similar challenges in future projects.
