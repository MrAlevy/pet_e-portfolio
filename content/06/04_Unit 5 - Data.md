# Data Collection

**_Think about which data collection tool will be suitable for your area of investigation (in this module and/or in your Project module). How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How will this answer your research question?_**
</br>

For my area of investigation, I will use literature review as my data collection tool. This tool involves gathering secondary data from existing publications, including:

- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Academic books
- Credible online resources
- Relevant reports or databases
  </br>

Using this tool, I will analyze previous research findings, theoretical frameworks, and evidence to address my research question.
</br>

**How the Data Will Be Collected**

- Conducting systematic searches in academic databases (e.g., Google Scholar) using keywords relevant to my topic.
- Filtering and selecting high-quality, credible sources based on relevance, publication date, and reliability.
- Organizing the collected data into themes for analysis.
  </br>

**How the Data Will Be Analyzed**

- Thematic Analysis: Grouping findings into key themes or trends.
- Comparative Analysis: Comparing findings across studies to identify agreements, differences, or gaps.
- Synthesis: Drawing conclusions that integrate findings from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of the topic.
  </br>

This approach will allow me to explore the existing body of knowledge comprehensively, offering insights without needing to conduct primary data collection.
</br>

**Relevance to My Research Question**
By using a literature review as my data collection tool, I will:

- Provide evidence-based answers to my research question.
- Identify trends and gaps in existing studies.
- Lay the groundwork for future research if additional primary data collection is required.

# Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

Inappropriate use of surveys can lead to serious ethical, legal, social, and professional implications, as illustrated by the Cambridge Analytica case. In 2018, Cambridge Analytica acquired data from millions of Facebook users through seemingly harmless personality quizzes (Confessore, 2018). These quizzes collected not only the data of the participants but also their Facebook friends' data, leveraging loopholes in Facebook’s API. The collected data was then used to influence political campaigns, including Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election, raising significant concerns about privacy violations and misuse of personal data.
</br>

## How This Happened and Why It Was Used

Surveys were designed to appear as fun and harmless tools to engage users. However, they requested permissions to access personal data, which users often granted without full awareness of the consequences.
The data collected was monetized and used for targeted advertising and political influence, demonstrating a misuse of research tools for commercial and ideological gains.
</br>

## Further Examples of Inappropriate Survey Use

**Facebook-Cornell Emotion Study (2014)**
Facebook manipulated the news feeds of users to test the emotional impact of positive or negative content, without obtaining informed consent (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock, 2014). This study raised concerns about the ethical boundaries of social media experiments and the potential psychological harm to users.
</br>

**TikTok User Surveys (2020)**
Surveys conducted on TikTok were criticized for collecting sensitive demographic and location data under the guise of improving user experience. It was later revealed that some data was accessible to external parties, violating user trust and potentially breaching GDPR regulations in Europe (Taylor, 2020).
</br>

## Impacts of These Examples

- Ethical Standpoint:
  These cases highlight violations of informed consent and autonomy, as users were unaware of how their data would be used or the potential consequences.

- Social Standpoint:
  Misuse of survey data undermines public trust in technology and research, leading to increased skepticism about participating in legitimate surveys.

- Legal Standpoint:
  Both Cambridge Analytica and similar cases faced investigations for breaching data protection laws, including the UK’s Data Protection Act and the EU’s GDPR. Fines and sanctions were imposed on organizations like Facebook.

- kProfessional Standpoint:
  Such incidents damage the reputation of the research profession, as they demonstrate a lack of adherence to professional standards like transparency, fairness, and respect for participants.
