## Case Analysis of Dark UX Patterns

In the "Dark UX Patterns" case, Stewart was asked to make website changes that misled users into choosing a more expensive product without clear consent. These changes included confusing arrows and a color scheme that made it hard for visually impaired users to see important details. Although these changes boosted revenue, they raised ethical concerns about fairness and user autonomy.

The ACM Code of Ethics emphasizes honesty (Principle 1.3), user autonomy (Principle 1.2), and the public good (Principle 1.1). Stewart’s situation highlights violations of these principles, as the design changes misleadingly guided users toward purchasing additional products. The color palette’s red and green combination also discriminated against visually impaired individuals, violating Principle 1.4. Furthermore, the client’s intent to increase revenue by misleading users undermined user dignity, conflicting with Principle 2.1, which calls for respectful treatment of all users. The case illustrates a failure to protect the public interest and prioritize user well-being.

The BCS Code of Conduct aligns closely with the ACM Code but has distinct provisions emphasizing non-discrimination (1.c) and competence (2.c). The BCS’s requirements to avoid misleading or exploiting users (3.e) and uphold public interest (1.a) resonate with the ethical violations observed in Stewart’s case. The company failed to act with integrity and did not address user feedback regarding the confusing interface, neglecting the BCS’s duty to maintain high professional standards.
