# Discussion Topic: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct

## Case Analysis of Dark UX Patterns

In the "Dark UX Patterns" case, Stewart was asked to make website changes that misled users into choosing a more expensive product without clear consent. These changes included confusing arrows and a color scheme that made it hard for visually impaired users to see important details. Although these changes boosted revenue, they raised ethical concerns about fairness and user autonomy.
</br>

The ACM Code of Ethics emphasizes honesty (Principle 1.3), user autonomy (Principle 1.2), and the public good (Principle 1.1). Stewart’s situation highlights violations of these principles, as the design changes misleadingly guided users toward purchasing additional products. The color palette’s red and green combination also discriminated against visually impaired individuals, violating Principle 1.4. Furthermore, the client’s intent to increase revenue by misleading users undermined user dignity, conflicting with Principle 2.1, which calls for respectful treatment of all users. The case illustrates a failure to protect the public interest and prioritize user well-being.
</br>

The BCS Code of Conduct aligns closely with the ACM Code but has distinct provisions emphasizing non-discrimination (1.c) and competence (2.c). The BCS’s requirements to avoid misleading or exploiting users (3.e) and uphold public interest (1.a) resonate with the ethical violations observed in Stewart’s case. The company failed to act with integrity and did not address user feedback regarding the confusing interface, neglecting the BCS’s duty to maintain high professional standards.

## Summary Post Based on Peer Responses

Peer review insights have broadened the discussion by highlighting important ethical, legal, and organizational aspects.
</br>

One significant point raised is the potential legal issues associated with dark UX patterns. Under consumer laws like the Federal Trade Commission Act in the U.S., such practices might be considered unfair or deceptive (Luguri & Strahilevitz, 2021). This suggests that computing professionals must consider not only ethical codes like those of the ACM and BCS but also industry-specific legal requirements. Our responsibilities extend beyond technology, affecting areas like commerce and consumer rights.
</br>

It was also suggested that advocating for transparent and user-centered design is crucial. Using accessible color schemes and straightforward options aligns with the principles of user autonomy and dignity in both the ACM and BCS codes. Research shows that ethical design enhances brand trust and reputation, while unethical practices can harm an organization's reputation over time (Brignull, 2013). This reinforces the importance of prioritizing ethical considerations in our design choices.
</br>

Additionally, the role of organizational policies was emphasized. Principle 3.4 of the ACM Code calls for clear policies that help professionals maintain high standards. Promoting public awareness, as suggested in Principle 2.7, can help users recognize unfair practices. By focusing on both internal policies and educating the public, we can better protect user interests.
</br>

In summary, as suggested in the comments, a comprehensive analysis of dark UX patterns should address ethical principles, legal obligations, and organizational responsibilities. These perspectives will help strengthen our approach and ensure we meet a broader scope of professional duties.
