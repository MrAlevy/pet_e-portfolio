# Research Proposal Review

**Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:**

- Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
- Which data collection methods would you consider using?
- Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?
  </br>

For my project, I chose to study the gender pay gap in the USA's tech sector. Even with progress, women in tech still face pay differences. These differences can come from job type, experience level, and workplace policies. This topic is important because it shows ongoing fairness issues and can push companies to create fairer policies and support diversity.
</br>

Given the scope of my project, a descriptive research design would be ideal, as it allows for an in-depth analysis of existing data on gender pay disparities in a structured manner (Saunders et al., 2019). This method aligns with quantitative research, which enables me to explore numerical data, identify patterns, and compare pay discrepancies across variables such as job role, experience, and industry segment within the U.S. tech sector. Secondary research will be my primary method of data collection. By using existing datasets, academic journals, and reports from reputable sources, I can access a comprehensive array of data to support my analysis without the need for primary data collection.
</br>

To effectively conduct this research, I will need to focus on several skills:

- Statistical analysis: Proficiency in this area will allow me to interpret and draw meaningful insights from the quantitative data I gather.
- Literature review: Skill in reviewing and synthesizing relevant literature is essential to understanding the broader context and identifying gaps in existing research.
- Data visualization: This will help in presenting findings clearly, especially when comparing trends and statistics across different demographics and roles.

# Peer Review Activity

For this peer review activity, I have selected two papers within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, each employing distinct research methodologies:

- Paper 1: "Artificial Intelligence in Disease Diagnosis: A Systematic Literature Review"
- Paper 2: "Capturing Artificial Intelligence Applications’ Value Proposition in Healthcare – A Qualitative Research Study"
  </br>

**Purpose and Research Question**

Paper 1: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of AI techniques used to diagnose various diseases, including Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, and more. The research question focuses on identifying how AI enhances hospital experiences and accelerates patient rehabilitation at home. This aligns with the ongoing exploration of AI's potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in healthcare.

Paper 2: This study explores the ethical considerations highlighted by experts in developing AI applications in healthcare. The research question addresses the importance of aligning AI development with ethical frameworks and the interests of doctors and patients. This contributes to the collective understanding of ethical challenges in AI integration within healthcare settings.
</br>

**Appropriateness of Research Methodology**

Paper 1: The authors utilize a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, which is appropriate for aggregating and synthesizing existing research on AI applications in disease diagnosis. This method allows for a structured analysis of current trends and gaps in the literature.

Paper 2: The study employs a qualitative research methodology, conducting semi-structured interviews with AI experts. This approach is suitable for exploring complex ethical considerations and obtaining in-depth insights into expert perspectives.
</br>

**Data Collection and Analysis**

Paper 1: Data collection involves selecting articles published up to October 2020 from databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The analysis includes examining medical imaging datasets, feature extraction, and classification processes for predictions. This method is appropriate for understanding the current state of AI applications in disease diagnosis.

Paper 2: Data is collected through semi-structured interviews with 41 AI experts. The data analysis employs reflective thematic analysis to identify key themes related to ethical considerations in AI development. This approach effectively captures the nuanced views of experts on ethical challenges.
</br>

**Support for Claims and Conclusions**

Paper 1: The paper supports its claims by providing a detailed survey of AI techniques used in diagnosing various diseases, including the datasets used, feature extraction methods, and classification processes. The systematic approach and comprehensive coverage lend credibility to the conclusions drawn about AI's role in disease diagnosis.

Paper 2: The study supports its conclusions by presenting three themes derived from expert interviews, highlighting the importance of clear objectives, balancing economic incentives with ethical considerations, and developing context-sensitive AI. The use of direct quotes and thematic analysis provides a solid foundation for the conclusions.
</br>

**Enhancements to the Work**

Paper 1: To enhance this paper, the authors could include a critical analysis of the limitations and challenges associated with implementing AI in disease diagnosis, such as data privacy concerns, integration with existing healthcare systems, and potential biases in AI algorithms.

Paper 2: The study could be improved by incorporating a diverse range of stakeholders, including patients and healthcare providers, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the ethical implications of AI in healthcare. Additionally, providing practical recommendations for integrating ethical considerations into AI development processes would be beneficial.
</br>

In summary, both papers contribute valuable insights into AI applications in healthcare, with one focusing on technical advancements and the other on ethical considerations. Their methodologies are appropriate for their respective research questions, and they provide substantial evidence to support their conclusions. Enhancements could include addressing implementation challenges and incorporating broader stakeholder perspectives.
