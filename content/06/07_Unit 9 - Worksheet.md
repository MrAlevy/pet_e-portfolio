# Exercise 9.1

```plaintext
Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.1D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the
percentage frequencies together with the bar chart just created in the above example. Add a
percentage frequency bar chart showing the brand preferences in Area 2, using the same format
as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example. Drag your new chart so that it lies
alongside that for Area 1.
Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand
preferences for each of the two demographic areas?
```

<br/>

The results indicate that Area 2 shows a stronger preference for both Brand A and Brand B compared to Area 1, with 21.1% and 33.3% respectively, as opposed to 15.7% and 24.3% in Area 1. Conversely, Area 1 has a higher preference for Other brands (60.0%) compared to Area 2 (45.6%). This suggests that Area 2 leans more towards established brands (A and B), while Area 1 exhibits a broader inclination toward alternative options.

# Exercise 9.2

```plaintext
Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.2E.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the frequency
distributions for Data Set E (see the Data Annexe) to which has been added the corresponding
percentage frequency distributions. Complete a percentage frequency clustered column bar chart
showing the heather species prevalence in the two different locations. Briefly interpret your
findings.
```

<br/>

The clustered column bar chart indicates that Area 2 has a higher preference for Brand A (21.1%) and Brand B (33.3%) compared to Area 1, where these values are 15.7% and 24.3%. Conversely, "Other" brands are more popular in Area 1 (60.0%) than in Area 2 (45.6%). This suggests that Area 2 has a stronger preference for established brands, while Area 1 shows greater interest in alternative options.

# Exercise 9.3

```plaintext
Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.3B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the relative
frequency histogram for the Diet A weight loss produced in Example 9.3 together with some of the
Diet B weight loss summary statistics. Add a relative frequency histogram of the weight loss for Diet
B, where possible using the same classes as those employed for the Diet A results in the above
example.
Briefly interpret your histogram. What do these results tell you about the patterns of weight loss for
each of the two diets?
```

<br/>

The relative frequency histograms highlight the differences in weight loss patterns between Diet A and Diet B.

<br/>

Most participants experienced moderate weight loss, concentrated around the 3-7 kg range, with the highest frequency (30%) at 5 kg and 7 kg.
The distribution is relatively balanced, with minimal extreme values at either end of the range.

<br/>

The weight loss pattern shows a higher proportion of participants in the 1-5 kg range, with a peak at 3 kg (30%) and slightly lower frequencies for larger weight loss classes.
The range for Diet B is broader, suggesting greater variability in results compared to Diet A.
<br/>

In summary, Diet A appears to produce more consistent weight loss results concentrated in the moderate range, while Diet B shows a wider range of outcomes, with a slightly higher frequency of participants achieving minimal weight loss.
