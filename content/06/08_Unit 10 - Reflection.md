# Reflection

Completing the inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and data visualisation exercises in Excel was both enlightening and rewarding. I had the opportunity to work through various scenarios‚Äîfrom comparing mean incomes across demographics to assessing the effectiveness of different diets and filtration agents. Engaging with these exercises allowed me to reinforce my understanding of core statistical concepts such as:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Computing measures of central tendency (mean, median), dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and interpreting what these values indicate about a dataset.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Applying t-tests (one-tailed and two-tailed), understanding p-values, and discussing assumptions like normality and equality of variances.
- **Data Visualisation**: Creating bar charts, histograms, and clustered column charts to present findings clearly-a crucial aspect of communicating research results.

<br/>

## Key Takeaways

- **Enhanced Confidence in Data Analysis**  
   Performing these tests repeatedly in Excel improved my overall comfort with statistical tools. By conducting both one-tailed and two-tailed tests, I gained greater insight into how different hypotheses can lead to different conclusions‚Äîan essential skill in research design.
- **Practical Understanding of Research Assumptions**  
   Each exercise highlighted the importance of verifying assumptions such as normality, independence, and homogeneity of variances. It made clear that misapplying these techniques or overlooking assumptions could compromise the validity of my conclusions.
- **Insight into Real-World Relevance**  
   The problems presented‚Äîranging from filtration methods to diet comparisons‚Äîdemonstrate the practical implications of statistical analysis. Whether in academia or industry, the ability to interpret data correctly can be the difference between meaningful insights and misleading interpretations.
- **Value of Clear Visual Presentation**  
   Working with histograms and bar charts showed how visuals can make data easier to understand. For example, a graph can quickly show if one diet works better than another, which might be harder to see just looking at numbers.

## Personal Opinion

I am truly pleased with this assessment, as it affirms my growing competence in statistical methods. This positive review motivates me to push further‚Äîexploring more advanced analytical tools (such as R or Python Statistical Libs) and applying these skills to larger or more complex datasets.

Learning Excel tests was just part of it-I now understand the whole process of working with data, from gathering and cleaning it to creating charts and drawing conclusions. These skills will help me in future tasks where I'll need to do more complex statistics and work with real data that isn't always clean and organized.

## Linking to Future Professional Practice

- **Interpreting Data at Work**  
  My improved facility with hypothesis testing and visualisation will help me make informed decisions and translate quantitative evidence into strategic recommendations.
- **Collaborative Projects**  
  Statistical assignments often require clear communication of findings to non-technical stakeholders. The charts, tables, and short explanations I practiced here will be invaluable for team-based projects or client presentations.
- **Continuous Learning**  
  This success encourages me to pursue more advanced certifications (e.g., data analytics, machine learning) and stay updated with the latest best practices in data-driven research.
