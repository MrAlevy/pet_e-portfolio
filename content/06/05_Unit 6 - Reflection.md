Looking back at my literature review, I can see both good points and areas where I can improve, based on tutor feedback and my second look at the sources. The main lesson I learned is that I need to do wider and deeper research. While using sources like PayScale (2022) helped me understand basic wage differences, I now see that looking at more studies, particularly ones about how different factors combine together (intersectionality), would have given me better insights and helped avoid repeating similar points.
</br>

Also, the feedback about making discussions more detailed connects well with the interesting findings from Cheryan and Markus (2020). Their idea about "masculine defaults" shows how normal workplace practices that seem neutral can actually create unfairness. My analysis would have been stronger if I had explored more about how these biases affect things like hiring processes and promotions. This shows why it's important to find research that looks deeper into both structural and cultural reasons, not just numbers and statistics.
</br>

One more area to improve is how I divided my paragraphs. Making longer paragraphs that combine related ideas is better for presenting a complete analysis. This helps make sure each argument is fully explained and developed, instead of being split into smaller parts that might weaken the main message.
</br>

To conclude, both my tutor's comments and my own thinking show that I need to look at more sources and organize my writing better. For future work, I plan to use more different types of research‚Äîboth from academic journals and industry reports‚Äîto make my critical analysis stronger. Also, I will focus on organizing my ideas into better-connected paragraphs that tell a clear story.

Looking back at my Research Proposal Presentation and the tutor's feedback, I am pleased that my knowledge, critical thinking, and communication were rated as excellent. The tutor appreciated how I presented the topic in a clear, focused, and chronological way, showing a good understanding of the content. They also highlighted how my critical analysis flowed naturally, supported by strong theories and research.
</br>

However, there are areas I could improve for future presentations. While the structure was good, the tutor suggested making the presentation more visually engaging. To address this, I could include more visual elements, like charts and infographics, to highlight key data and examples from both large companies and startups. This would make it easier for the audience to understand why changes like transparent pay systems are important.
</br>

Although my presentation speed and introduction were praised, I realize I could make the connections between slides stronger. Clearly linking data points and arguments would help keep the presentation engaging and make practical suggestions, like the Employer Toolkit and Policy Brief, even clearer.
</br>

To conclude, by improving my visual elements and making clearer connections between ideas, I could strengthen my presentation skills while maintaining the strong theoretical foundation that was praised in the feedback.
