# Action Plan
The Personal Development Plan in the table sets out a clear path for improving my skills in areas like project planning and leadership. It shows where I'm doing well and where I need to work harder, with specific steps for getting better. The skills I've been working on are already helping me at my job. I now understand how our project terms and budgets are put together, and I'm quick to spot any issues. My approach has become more thoughtful. When I look at schedules and estimates, I see a well-planned system with clear reasons behind each part. This has made me a more effective team member and leader, and I'm confident that as I keep following this plan, I'll continue to grow in these roles.
