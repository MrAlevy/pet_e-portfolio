# Estimating Tools and Risk Assessment

Reflecting on the risks the authors pointed out about working with teams spread across different places, I see how not being able to meet in person can really affect how well a team works together. It's clear that not meeting face-to-face can make it harder for team members to trust each other, make good decisions, be creative, and manage work well. This lack of in-person interaction can also make it tough for the team to learn from each other and build up knowledge on how to work well together.

The issue with choosing the right technology and tools for the team also stood out to me. If the technology doesn't work well across different locations, it can cause a lot of problems. It's crucial to pick the right tools that everyone can use easily to make sure the project goes smoothly.

Another big challenge is just how hard it can be to plan and coordinate work when everyone is in different places and time zones. It can make meetings hard to schedule, slow down getting feedback, and even make simple tasks more complicated.

Lastly, the risk of language differences really hit home. If team members speak different languages, it can lead to misunderstandings and important details being missed. This made me think about how important clear communication is and finding ways to make sure everyone understands each other.

All these risks show how tricky it can be to work with a team that's not all in the same place. It makes me want to look more into how we can use tools and methods to improve working together, even when we're far apart, to make sure we can still do great work together (Verner et al. 2014; Anton and Nucu 2020).

# Project Failure
_Question 1: What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?_
The Lehtinen et al. (2014) paper highlights several factors contributing to project failure. Based on the information presented, the three most common reasons for project failure are:
- Chaotic Project Environment: The project environment, encompassing organizational properties and environmental conditions, plays a significant role in project outcomes. A chaotic environment, characterized by rapid changes in business landscapes, unclear priorities, and dynamic market demands, is identified as a common cause for project overruns and failures.
- People-Related Causes: Social interaction, skills, and motivation of the individuals involved in the project are critical factors influencing its success. Stakeholder conflicts, breakdowns in communication, and the lack of team spirit can lead to project failures. 
- Methods Used in the Project: The work practices employed by project members, including developers, users, and management, are crucial. Failures related to project methods may occur at every stage of the project, affecting its overall outcome.
</br>
These three reasons are interrelated, as a chaotic project environment can impact social interactions and motivation, and the methods used in the project are influenced by both the project environment and the people involved.

_Question 2: Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast)._
LSE Taurus System (Goatham, 2020)
The LSE Taurus system is an example of market and strategy-related failure. It suffered from poor market intelligence, inadequate analysis, and the use of outdated technologies. The result was a product that did not meet the required standards, design, and ultimately became obsolete. 
US FAA Advanced Automation System (Bar Yam, 2003)
The failure of the US FAA Advanced Automation System serves as an illustrative case for organization and planning-related failure. The project encountered scheduling issues, problems with procurement, and attempted to implement significant changes in a too rapid manner. These challenges led to project delays and, in some aspects, project failure.
