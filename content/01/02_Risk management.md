# Estimating Tools and Risk Assessment

Reflecting on the risks the authors pointed out about working with teams spread across different places, I see how not being able to meet in person can really affect how well a team works together. It's clear that not meeting face-to-face can make it harder for team members to trust each other, make good decisions, be creative, and manage work well. This lack of in-person interaction can also make it tough for the team to learn from each other and build up knowledge on how to work well together.

The issue with choosing the right technology and tools for the team also stood out to me. If the technology doesn't work well across different locations, it can cause a lot of problems. It's crucial to pick the right tools that everyone can use easily to make sure the project goes smoothly.

Another big challenge is just how hard it can be to plan and coordinate work when everyone is in different places and time zones. It can make meetings hard to schedule, slow down getting feedback, and even make simple tasks more complicated.

Lastly, the risk of language differences really hit home. If team members speak different languages, it can lead to misunderstandings and important details being missed. This made me think about how important clear communication is and finding ways to make sure everyone understands each other.

All these risks show how tricky it can be to work with a team that's not all in the same place. It makes me want to look more into how we can use tools and methods to improve working together, even when we're far apart, to make sure we can still do great work together (Verner et al. 2014; Anton and Nucu 2020).

# Project Failure
_Question 1: What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?_
The Lehtinen et al. (2014) paper highlights several factors contributing to project failure. Based on the information presented, the three most common reasons for project failure are:
- Chaotic Project Environment: The project environment, encompassing organizational properties and environmental conditions, plays a significant role in project outcomes. A chaotic environment, characterized by rapid changes in business landscapes, unclear priorities, and dynamic market demands, is identified as a common cause for project overruns and failures.
- People-Related Causes: Social interaction, skills, and motivation of the individuals involved in the project are critical factors influencing its success. Stakeholder conflicts, breakdowns in communication, and the lack of team spirit can lead to project failures. 
- Methods Used in the Project: The work practices employed by project members, including developers, users, and management, are crucial. Failures related to project methods may occur at every stage of the project, affecting its overall outcome.
</br>
These three reasons are interrelated, as a chaotic project environment can impact social interactions and motivation, and the methods used in the project are influenced by both the project environment and the people involved.
</br>

_Question 2: Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast)._
LSE Taurus System (Goatham, 2020)
The LSE Taurus system is an example of market and strategy-related failure. It suffered from poor market intelligence, inadequate analysis, and the use of outdated technologies. The result was a product that did not meet the required standards, design, and ultimately became obsolete. 
US FAA Advanced Automation System (Bar Yam, 2003)
The failure of the US FAA Advanced Automation System serves as an illustrative case for organization and planning-related failure. The project encountered scheduling issues, problems with procurement, and attempted to implement significant changes in a too rapid manner. These challenges led to project delays and, in some aspects, project failure.

## Peer Response

Hi Aleksandr,

Thanks for sharing your insights into the questions regarding project failure. Your analysis provides a good foundation, and here are a few observations that may improve your post for clarity and depth.

The examples given (LSE Taurus System and US FAA Advanced Automation System) are relevant and add value to the response. However, they could be enhanced by explicitly linking them to the three identified reasons for project failure. This would strengthen the argument by demonstrating how each example aligns with the previously discussed factors.
Consider providing a brief context for each case study to help readers unfamiliar with these projects. This background can include the industry, the project's goals, and any notable details that make the examples more accessible.
I hope you find these suggestions helpful. Thanks again for sharing.

Hi Emmanuel!

Thanks for your thoughts on project failures topics, namely the LSE Taurus System and the US FAA Advanced Automation System. Your points about problems in market and strategy for the LSE Taurus and organization and planning for the US FAA give a good picture of why projects can go wrong.

The idea to connect the examples more directly to the three reasons for project failure is smart. It would make the argument stronger and help people understand each failure better.

Also, your suggestion to give a quick background for each case is helpful. Adding details about the industry, project goals, and what makes each example stand out would make it easier for people who don't know these projects. However, I have provided the references which can help with the context, and expanding this within the post was not the initial point of it.

Thanks for you feedback!

## Summary

I appreciate the insightful feedback provided by my peers on my initial post regarding the three most common reasons for project failure and the examples supporting these choices. The feedback highlights the importance of explicitly linking the examples to the identified reasons for project failure and providing a brief context for better understanding (Koranteng, 2023).
</br>

In response to the feedback, I acknowledge the need to strengthen the connection between the examples and the identified factors contributing to project failure. For the LSE Taurus System, it's crucial to emphasize how market and strategy-related failures, such as poor market intelligence and the use of outdated technologies, align with a chaotic project environment. Additionally, for the US FAA Advanced Automation System, the planning and organization-related failures, such as scheduling issues and problems with procurement, should be explicitly tied to people-related causes and project methods.
</br>

To enhance the clarity and depth of my post, I could integrate these specific connections between the examples and the identified reasons for project failure. This would provide a more robust understanding of how the real-world cases align with the theoretical framework presented in the initial post.
Furthermore, I recognize the value of providing a brief context for each case study to make them more accessible to readers unfamiliar with these projects. This will include details about the industry, project goals, and any notable aspects that contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the examples.
</br>

In addition, after reviewing Lehtinen's paper about project failures, I could incorporate additional insights into my initial post. Lehtinen et al. (2014) found reasons why software projects fail and stressed how crucial it is to grasp the connections between these reasons.
</br>

By incorporating these suggestions into my summary post, I could improve the overall coherence and depth of the discussion on project failure, ensuring a stronger alignment between theory and real-world examples.
