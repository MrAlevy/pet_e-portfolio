# Challenges
The project aimed to foster effective teamwork among students by assigning specific roles and engaging in detailed planning, including cost estimations and requirement analysis. The reflection highlights several challenges encountered, including:
- **Role Distribution and Team Dynamics:** The large team size made traditional role-based management impractical, leading to a decision to distribute project milestones and requirements instead of specific roles. This approach aimed to simplify collaboration but resulted in a lack of comprehensive project understanding among team members.
- **Project Planning and Execution:** The absence of a role-based structure initially seemed advantageous for an educational setting but eventually led to issues in maintaining project integrity and coherence. Each team member focused on isolated tasks without a unified vision, impacting the project's overall integration.
- **Communication and Coordination Challenges:** Significant difficulties in communication arose from a large number of team members, time zone differences, and varied backgrounds. The lack of a defined meeting schedule and insufficient frequency of meetings exacerbated these issues, hindering effective team collaboration and decision-making.
- **Adaptation to Project Requirements:** Mid-project realization of the disconnected nature of workpieces highlighted the drawbacks of the chosen approach. Different parts of the project were developed based on inconsistent methodologies, leading to confusion and lack of coherence.
- **Reflections on Improvement:** The experience underscored the importance of clear role assignments, regular and structured communication, and a unified approach to project management. It suggests that assigning specific roles and having a central leadership figure could enhance project cohesion and effectiveness, despite the potential challenges of managing a large team.

# My Contribution
My role involved creating the project plan, including timeframes, justifications, and a Gantt chart. I based this on the group's initial data and the agreed-upon approach, outlining all required project stages on a timeline and providing justifications for each.
</br>

This task was challenging for me. Although I had previous experience in project planning, this was unlike anything I had done before. The strict one-year timeline, from the start of development to the beginning of mass production, was particularly perplexing. As I delved into the project stages, I quickly realized that not only was the total term implausible, but even developing the first stage of the project with a ready and tested circuit within a year seemed nearly impossible. Consequently, I had to compress everything, from hardware design to market production.
Initially, the idea was to utilize real-time boxes and distribute work among several teams. Yet, this approach was quickly found impractical due to two main issues: the necessity for each project phase to be completed before starting the next, and our budget limitations making it impossible to hire multiple teams. Consequently, the project had to be adjusted to fit within a one-year timeframe, a decision that was not satisfying then and remains regrettable. Reflecting on it, it would have been better to renegotiate the project timelines, explaining that the initial plan was unfeasible, though such a route was not available at the time.
</br>

Another significant aspect of my contribution to the project was my proactive approach. Leveraging my relevant background, I endeavored to help the team organize and maintain a unified direction.
I took the lead in most of our meetings, ensuring that everyone had the opportunity to speak and that each opinion was considered. This approach established a truly democratic team environment, as we voted on common decisions.
In addition to my leadership role, I created and maintained our meeting minutes document, which was crucial for tracking our discussions and decisions.
I also made an effort to review every part of our project and identified numerous discrepancies. Unfortunately, due to the issues mentioned earlier, my ability to review the work was limited. I couldnâ€™t review each part more than once, and as I addressed issues in one area, new issues emerged in another.
In hindsight, if we had worked within a role-based model, it might have been easier to implement a strict review process. However, the large number of people in the team presented a significant challenge to conducting effective reviews.

# Outcomes
The project was a significant learning experience for me, marked by a mix of emotions and insights. Initially, I was excited about the teamwork and learning opportunities. However, as we faced challenges in communication and role distribution, frustration and concern arose. These feelings led me to be more proactive and seek solutions, despite feeling at times unsure due to the project's complexities which exceeded my previous experience in project planning. During this process, I attempted to apply the `Adjusted Function Point Estimation Program`, which I learned in **module 5**, to calculate the project's complexity. However, I realized that this method is more effective when used in conjunction with data from previous projects to accurately tie story points to actual time frames.
</br>

This experience taught me the value of clear communication, structured management, and adaptability in team settings, aligning with the literature that highlights the importance of these elements in project success. The project acted as a catalyst for understanding the dynamics of teamwork and project management. I learned that a structured approach with defined roles and regular meetings could address many issues. This insight has changed my approach to team projects, emphasizing early role definition and consistent communication.
