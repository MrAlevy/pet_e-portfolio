# Components of User Experience

The Components of User Experience (CUE) model, proposed by Thüring and Mahlke, outlines the sequence involving systems, users, and context, illustrating their impact on the user experience. To better align with the evolving landscape of human emotion, a slight modification to the model can be considered.
</br>

In this perspective, a temporal layer is introduced to take into account the fluctuating nature of emotional responses throughout the user journey. The sequential flow extends to highlight distinct emotional phases, recognizing that perceptions of both non-instrumental and instrumental qualities, along with consequential judgments, are subject to temporal variations.
</br>

The updated model gives more importance to how people feel, express themselves, and react physically. It's essential to acknowledge that these feelings can change over time. By adding a feedback loop, the model can continuously adapt based on real-time emotions.
</br>

By making the CUE model more flexible, we can better understand how people's emotions change over time. This approach gives us a complete framework to grasp user experiences and stay in sync with how emotions evolve. This updated view not only captures the details of emotional reactions but also helps create designs that connect with users' changing feelings. It contributes to a more all-encompassing and adaptable approach to designing user experiences (Minge and Thüring, 2018).

Hi Aleksandr,

Thank you for your post. Your suggestion for the modified model addresses the dynamic nature of emotional responses throughout the user journey. The idea of introducing a feedback loop to continuously adapt the model based on real-time emotions is practical and forward-thinking.

To add to your post, I think it would be interesting to consider the implications of your temporal layer modification in diverse user contexts. Investigating how cultural or demographic factors may influence the temporal dynamics of emotional responses could provide a more inclusive understanding of user experiences. Elfenbein (2007) suggests that emotional experiences are not universal but are significantly shaped by cultural and demographic backgrounds. Incorporating cultural considerations into the temporal layer modification could mean acknowledging that emotional responses may vary across different societies or ethnic groups. For instance, certain emotions might be expressed more openly in some cultures, while others may favor a more restrained approach(Matsumoto & Juang, 2016). Understanding these nuances is crucial for ensuring that the model remains effective and resonant across various user groups.

Hi Both
I liked the idea of a temporal model - how would that be integrated and how would you measure its effect?
</br>

## Summary

Anna's idea to think about cultural and demographic differences in how people experience emotions is really helpful. It makes the model work better for everyone, no matter where they're from. As Elfenbein (2007) and Matsumoto & Juang (2016) point out, people in different places might feel and show their emotions in varied ways. So, if we adjust the model to consider these differences, we can make sure it fits a wide range of users. This approach helps in making designs that truly connect with people from all kinds of backgrounds.
</br>

Doug brings up a good point about how we can actually use this updated model and see if it's working. To do this, we could keep asking users how they feel about the designs at different stages and see if their responses change over time. We can talk to users, watch how they use the designs, or even use surveys and technology to measure their reactions. By looking at how users' feelings and satisfaction change, we can get a clear idea of whether the new model is making a difference.
</br>

Both suggestions highlight the need to keep updating our models to better understand and respond to how users feel. By paying attention to cultural differences and continuously checking in with users, we can create experiences that truly resonate with a diverse audience.
